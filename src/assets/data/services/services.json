          "There are many cloud platforms available to organizations today, and each platform varies in offerings, maturity, vision, and price. Evaluating and selecting the correct platform might not be straightforward given the initiatives your company has in flight, the skill sets of your current employees, or even the different technical allegiances across teams or departments within your organization. Should you standardize on a single public cloud or utilize multiple for different use cases?\n\nIntersys brings broad and deep cloud expertise to assist in cloud platform selection, giving you an experienced and agnostic partner that will recommend a cloud platform strategy that’s tailored to your unique organization.",

For instance, your data may be on-premise, but you still want to take advantage of a service offering from a cloud provider. Or maybe security policy has prevented your organization from storing certain types of data in the cloud, and therefore you need a hybrid solution accommodating both on-premise and cloud components. Intersys can help your organization identify when a hybrid solution is in order, or simplify the implementation of your hybrid cloud solution thanks to our years of cloud services expertise.",
